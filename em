3|Dear Friend,Greetings to you.I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.WEBSITE.http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.|1|
4|MR. CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. Free DVD I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoy par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com|1|

23|Madame Secretary:Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and RicardoLagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point it appears wehave a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C. stop in Miami to pick up RicardoLagos and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubtabout our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates itsAmerica's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday Representative Connie Mack didthe same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough stalwart guy. Heand his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.Finally we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identifyfurther opportunities for your engagement.I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key momentsand take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented adebilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of ourefforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us and for that we are grateful to you.RegardsTom|0|

25|Dear Sir or Madam:We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:I. Background:Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp.

In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.The Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.III. Content of the projectIt is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from114 to 339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.IV. Product specificationsFor Casing: grade of steel are J55 and N80, specification ranges from 114 to 339.7For delivery: grade of steel are X52X60X70, specification ranges from 114 to 339.7.V. Economic AnalysisThe total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.The break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.VI. Plans for cooperationWe have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:a. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35b. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30c.

38|PRIVATEDear sir/Madam,I am Ben Maluleke, a Native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an director and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Seven Million, One Hundred Thousand united states dollars (US$27,100,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf into a reliable company/individual account depending on your convenience.More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance the whole transaction. This amount (US$27.1m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured tel/fax number whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matterbecause we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.|1|

40|FROM:MR. MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM.BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,BANK OF AFRICA(B.O.A),DAKAR, SENEGAL.Dear friend,I know that this letter may come to you as a suprise. I got your contact address from the Internet when I was searching for a business partner.My name is MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM. I am the Bill and Exchange Manager of bank of africa(B.O.A) ,Dakar Senegal.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of USD$22.3 Million (TWEN TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife  and children in a plane crash in  year 2001 plane crash happened in Cote d'Ivoire.(Kenya Air Ways)Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I  decided to make this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it because I don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after  five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a Senegalaise cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I have agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me, after which I shall visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as i arranged,you will furnished me with a good receving account detail where the money will be transfered, your private tel and fax number for easy communication.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance director,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the transfer.Please I would like you  keep this transaction confidential and as a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a Bank official.Trusting to hear from you immediately.Yours Sincerely,MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM._________________________________________________________________FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar - get it now! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/|1|

I want to inquire from you if you can handle this transaction for mutual benefits/life opportunity for you and me.The transaction is about seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin/ beneficiary of the US$4.3 million dollars,(four million,three hundred thousand united states dollars), and who is a customer to the bank where i work.He died in a Kenya plane crash 2003.The Fund is currently in a suspense account awaiting claim, the bank made a public notice that they are ready to release this fund to any of his relatives abroad.I am as convinced as believing that you will provide me, the very needed urgent assistance, hence a viable bank account by which we can effect the transfer of the fund.Because,due to our position as top bank officials, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account, that is why i needed you to assist me in providing a foreign bank where this FUND will be transfered for immediate disbursement according to the percentages.You can view this site to know more.http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_newsews.php articleid=35537.THEREFORE,by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL, top secret should be maintained please!,because i am still in the active service i do not need any form of implication especially now i'm in the verge of my retirement to endanger my carear at last!.Since we got the information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws.In that regard, i decided to seek your consent for this prospective opportunity. Have it at the back of your mind, that the transaction does not involve any RISK, and does not need much engagement from you, since i am familiar with this kind of transaction being an insider. Necessary modalities will be worked out to enable us carry out the fund claim under a legitimate arrangement.

(Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).Back in the US the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the WashingtonPost's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that ""there were zero building starts in the WestBank settlements.""During the week of June 21 I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to documentnew settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at HarHoma a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoingconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.0Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after heannounced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a falsedistinction between the West Bank and ""parts of Jerusalem"" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeligovernment flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009 ""We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank andJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such."" With a few exceptions Obama allowed this scheme to goforward.According to the Washington Post Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuringJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported""The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues including the expiration of amoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September."" This may mean an end to the settlement freeze but it wasonly an illusion after all."|0|
